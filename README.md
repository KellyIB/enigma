Self Evaluation for Enigma

Functionality: 3 (Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented.)

Object Oriented Programming: 4 (Students have implemented either inheritance or at least one module in a logical manner. Students can speak as to how/why inheritance and modules made sense for the given implementations, why they improve the organization of the code, and the distinction between the two.)

Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: 4 (Classes, methods, and variables are well named so that they clearly communicate their purpose. Code is all properly indented and syntax is consistent. No methods are longer than 10 lines long. Most enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen. )

Test Driven Development: 3-4 (Mocks and/or stubs are used appropriately to ensure two or more of the following: testing is more robust (i.e., testing methods that might not otherwise be tested due to factors like randomness or user input), testing is more efficient, or that classes can be tested without relying on functionality from other classes. Students are able to speak as to how mocks and/or stubs are fulfilling the above conditions. Test coverage metrics show 100% coverage. // Every method is tested at both the unit and integration level, and completely verify expected behavior (i.e., if a single method does 3 things, all 3 things are explicitly tested). Obvious edge cases are addressed. git history demonstrates students are writing tests before implementation code. Test coverage metrics show coverage at 99% or greater.)

Version Control: 4 (At least 30 commits. Most pull requests include related and logical chunks of functionality, and are named and documented to clearly communicate the purpose of the pull request. No more than 3 commits include multiple pieces of functionality.)
